# Radiology-Report-Classification
This project classifies radiology reports using deep learning models to determine if findings are normal or abnormal. It involves data exploration, splitting into training and testing sets, and preparing data for NLP with tokenization and numericalization. A language model is built to understand report context, and word embeddings convert text to numerical data for model training. The core is training a deep learning model for classification. This approach aids healthcare by providing quick, accurate analysis of radiology reports, enhancing diagnostic efficiency and patient care.
